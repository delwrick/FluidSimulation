# Fluid Simulation

A real-time 2D fluid simulation built in Unity 6. This project simulates the behavior of fluid particles in a confined space, allowing interactive control of pressure, temperature, and boundary dynamics. Designed as both a physics demo and an educational tool.

---

## 🌀 Features

- Particle-based fluid simulation
- Dynamic boundary container
- Real-time temperature & pressure visualization
- Adjustable parameters via Unity UI sliders
- Optimized for clarity and performance

---

## 🔧 Built With

- **Unity** 6000.0.46f1 (Tech Stream)
- C# scripting
- Unity's built-in 2D physics system
- Custom simulation and visualization logic

---

## 🎮 How to Run

1. Open the project in [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
2. Make sure you are using **Unity 6000.0.46f1** or later
3. Open the main scene (likely in `Assets/Scenes/`)
4. Press ▶️ Play in the Unity Editor to run the simulation
